In some cases it may be necessary to specify an encoding for your assets. An example might be for Japanese characters in a javascript file. To do this 2 things must be done. First we simply set the charset attribute when we include are javascript file:

{code}
<asset:javascript src="application.js" charset="utf-8"/>
{code}

This should take care of testing in development mode and debugging. However, when we move to production/war mode the precompiler has no way to infer the desired encoding for compilation. To accomplish this we have the @//= encoding@ directive. This can be placed at the top of your @application.js@ to define the desired compilation encoding.

{code}
//=encoding UTF-8
//=require_self
//=require_tree .
{code}

That's all there is to it.
